    <h2>A little bit about me—</h2>
<hr>
    <p>Hey, I'm Safwan, a UX/UI designer with strengths in user & market research, website design, and front-end development.</p>

    <p>
        I'm currently a UX Content Strategist at AnywhereTax. My past expereince include working as a marketing & design head at MIST and
        interning at two tech startups (Backspace & Clutch!). My education includes obtaining a Bachelors of Science in Marketing from

        more front-end development online.

        I absolutley love talking to and learning from people and emapthizing with their journeys'. It excites me to be able to express 
        my creativty through desigining delightful and engaging digital expereinces to solve complex problems. I believe successful designs come 
        through feedback and constant itteration.

        Don't be a stranger, hit me up! I'm always open to connect for work opportunities & projects. Some of my other passions include Islamic studies,
        basketball (a die hard Atlanta Hawks fan), anime, video games, & reading non fiction. (check out my <a href="./virtual-bookshelf.html">virtual bookshelf</a>)
